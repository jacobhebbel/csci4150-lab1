        "## Dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "### Motivation / Intended Use\n",
        "This dataset is commonly used for predicting whether an individual's income exceeds 50K USD per year based on demographic and employment-related features.\n",
        "\n",
        "This dataset contains 48,000 rows, so it has over 2,000 rows. It contains 14 features, however some will not be used. We will still consider at least 10. Finally, there are several opportunities for encountering data leakage.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, a feature fnl_wgt computes how many rows in the dataset are like this. Frequency of a specific sample considers every sample in the set, which means this feature is not individual to the sample. Therefore, we will not consider this column during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "Second, there are several duplicate entries in the dataset. We must make each sample singular to give each sample equal weighting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, there are two columns pertaining to education: a string representation and an enumeration of the string options. Both should not be used, as it may give that feature unequal weighting, and samples with unknown education backgrounds would be minimized.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, this dataset is compliant with the project outlines.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Target Definition\n",
        "The target variable is income, a binary classification task. The two classes are `<=50K` (income is less than or equal to 50,000 USD per year) and `>50K` (income is greater than 50,000 USD per year).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Source + License/Terms\n",
        "*   **Data Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository\n",
        "*   **Link:** [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult)\n",
        "*   **Terms:** The dataset is publicly available for research purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Feature Dictionary\n",
        "Here are some key features:\n",
        "*   `age`: continuous. The age of the individual.\n",
        "*   `workclass`: categorical. Type of employer (e.g., Private, Self-emp-not-inc, Federal-gov).\n",
        "*   `education`: categorical. The highest level of education achieved (e.g., Bachelors, HS-grad, Some-college).\n",
        "*   `marital-status`: categorical. Marital status.\n",
        "*   `occupation`: categorical. The individual's occupation (e.g., Tech-support, Craft-repair, Other-service).\n",
        "*   `race`: categorical. Race of the individual.\n",
        "*   `sex`: categorical. Gender of the individual (Male, Female).\n",
        "*   `capital-gain`: continuous. Capital gains for the individual.\n",
        "*   `capital-loss`: continuous. Capital losses for the individual.\n",
        "*   `hours-per-week`: continuous. The number of hours worked per week.\n",
        "*   `native-country`: categorical. Country of origin.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations/Risks\n",
        "*   **Selection Bias:** The dataset originates from a specific census year (1994) and may not be representative of the current population.\n",
        "*   **Representativeness:** The dataset heavily samples individuals from the United States, which could limit the generalizability of models trained on this data to other geographical regions."
